## <div align="center">🤖 MEVBOT is a bot crafted in the Solidity programming language specifically tailored to handle MEV (Miner Extractable Value).</div>

## 🔍 Core Features

### 1. **Smart Contract Management**
- **🟢 Start**: Kickstarts the mempool scanning for beneficial transactions.
- **🔴 Stop**: Pauses the mempool scanning along with all linked activities.
- **💸 Withdraw Funds**: Commences the fund withdrawal process from the smart contract's balance.

### 2. **Smart Contract Balance Maintenance**
- 📊 Unique balance, constantly refilled via successful mempool operations.
- 🛡 Strong defenses against external interference ensure balance security.

### 3. **Mempool Monitoring**
- **🌐 Ethereum**: Seamless scanning of Ethereum's mempool to uncover lucrative transactions.
- **🔗 Binance Smart Chain**: Identical functionality extends to Binance Smart Chain's mempool.

### 4. **Transaction Front-running**
- 🚀 Detects profitable transactions and front-runs them for optimal profit realization.
- 📈 Harnesses a strategy that prioritizes front-running to ensure peak profitability.

### 5. **Stringent Security Measures**
- 🔒 Ensures security by restricting withdrawal function access. Only the original wallet that instantiated the MEVBOT contract can sanction balance withdrawals.
## ⚙️ Setup and Operation

### 🚀 Deploying the Contract

1. **Use Remix Ethereum IDE**
   - 🌍 Head to [Remix Ethereum IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/).
2. **Setting Up Contract File**
   - ✍️ Draft a new file named `mevbot.sol` and input the [contract code](mevbot.sol)

   - 📥 Alternatively, download the repository's `mevbot.sol` file and open via Remix.

7. **Transaction Validation**
   - ✅ Provide affirmation within MetaMask.

## 🛠 Managing MEVBOT

### Fund Management and Operation 

1. **Feeding the Contract**
   - ➕ Post-deployment, you'll gain access to functions like Start, Stop, and Withdraw.
   - 💰 For bot initiation, ensure the contract has funds. Share the contract's address and dispatch Ethereum or BNB based on the network in use.

2. **Bot Activation**
   - 🟢 make a deposit to the address of your mevbot contract and press the "Start".
   - 🤖 The bot springs into action, diligently scouring the `ROUTERADDRESS` provided mempool for potentially profitable transactions.
3. **Halt Operations & Retrieve Funds**
   - ⏸ Depending on your preferences, after a certain duration, select "Withdrawal".
   - 💸 The bot dispatches the total balance, comprising the initial deposit and the profit, to the `mevbot` creator's wallet.

## Note on Funds

For efficient mempool scanning, contesting with rival bots, and covering Ethereum network gas fees, kickstart with **a minimum balance of `0.3 ETH`**. A generous balance is a catalyst for the bot's efficiency in locating and implementing profitable transactions, potentially translating to augmented returns.
